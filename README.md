elemental
=========

Composition calculator for chemicals

Features
========
* Mass spectrum prediction for the [M]+ ion#
  * includes isotopic data from 1997 composition information
  * data can be seen to check used amounts
  * where an element is radioactive, or no known isotopic data exists, then [M]+ cannot be calculated
* predicted elemental composition
* elemental analysis from experimental results
* determining needed chemical amounts for filling in COSSH forms
* works offline in the browser.  No information is ever sent out, apart from google analytics information
 
To use
======
Simply point your browser at the file here on git.  Or, save it to your computer.  Modern browsers will need only to save one file, making it easier to move around once saved

Why it was built
================
Simply, I needed it in 2008 during my PHD.  It's been available online, but I wanted to improve the code (certain parts are horrible), make it cleaner, and improve performance where possible
